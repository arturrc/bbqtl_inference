# BB-QTL Inference Pipelines
This repo accompanies the research article "Barcoded Bulk QTL mapping reveals highly
polygenic and epistatic architecture of complex traits in yeast" by Nguyen Ba AN, 
Lawrence KM, Rego-Costa A, Gopalakrishnan S, Temko D, Michor F, and Desai M (2021).

It contains the pipelines necessary for processing of raw sequencing reads into
data for QTL inference.

Raw sequencing reads were uploaded to NCBI SRA under accession PRJNA767876.

The output of these pipelines are deposited in Dryad:
